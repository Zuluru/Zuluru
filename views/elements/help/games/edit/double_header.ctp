<p>If the "Allow double-headers" box is checked, you will be allowed to schedule the same team in more than one game slot, though the system will still ensure that all such games are at the same facility and not in overlapping times.</p>
<p>If this box is not checked, the system will ensure that you have not scheduled the same team more than once.</p>
<p>Checks are always done to make sure that the same game slot is not booked more than once.</p>
