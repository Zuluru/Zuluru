<p>USA Ultimate developed their current College ranking system to replace the RRI system. It is not clear what weakness in RRI was being addressed with this change.</p>
<p>With the USA Ultimate College system, ratings are re-calculated on a daily basis, taking into account the strength of each team's schedule. For example, if your first game was a loss to a low-ranked team who later prove themselves to have been initially under-estimated, the penalty for that loss will be reduced as the season progresses.</p>

<p class="warning-message">NOTE: For ratings to be re-calculated, you MUST have a daily cron job set up as described in the README file.</p>
