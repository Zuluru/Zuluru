<p>The Approve Scores page shows coordinators a list of past games which have not yet been finalized and allows them to be edited.</p>
<p>This is most commonly required when the captains submit scores that do not match. In this case, there is also an "email captains" link on this page which will allow you to easily contact the captains and assistants from both teams; captains can edit their score submission, which will allow the game to be automatically finalized.</p>
<p>Games which have had one score submitted will typically be automatically finalized by the system after a set time; if this option is turned off, coordinators may need to use this page to finalize such games.</p>
