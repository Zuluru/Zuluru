<p>Occasionally, you may need to wipe out an entire day's worth of games from the schedule.
To do this, simply use the "delete day" link for that day on the division schedule.
You will be required to confirm your request; take this opportunity to double-check that the date is correct and the number of games to be deleted is what you expect.
You will also be given an additional warning if the games you are deleting have been published.</p>
