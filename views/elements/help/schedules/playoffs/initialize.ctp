<p>Once all regular season results have been received and the final standings are determined, use the "Initialize Schedule Dependencies" link from the division schedule page to replace all of the "nth seed" placeholders in the schedule with the correct teams.</p>
<p>This initialize process can be run any number of times, in case something happens to alter the standings after it is run the first time (e.g. a previously confirmed score is disputed).</p>
