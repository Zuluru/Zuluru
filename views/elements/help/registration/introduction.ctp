Each event will have an open and close date, which indicate the window during which you can register for that event.
Some events may be free, most will have a cost associated with them.
Some organizations will have an annual membership that you must register for before anything else.
Other events may allow you to create a team, join a "hat" team, or sign up for a clinic or social event.
The options available to you will depend on what your organization offers.</p>
