<p>Use this to define the list of events which should be considered as alternatives to this event. Any events listed as alternates will be shown in the "You may alternately be interested in..." area when viewing an event to register for.</p>
<p>Alternates are always bi-directional, so adding event Y as an alternate to X will also add event X as an alternate to Y.</p>
<p>Note that other events associated with the same division, if any, will automatically be included there and don't need to be included in this list.</p>
