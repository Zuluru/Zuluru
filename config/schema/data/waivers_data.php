<p>While the sport of Ultimate is understood to be a non-contact sport, this does not mean that contact does not occur. Ultimate is a fast paced, athletic sport, and as such has all of the attendant risks that are commonly associated with such an activity. While all players are expected to adhere to the Spirit of the Game as outlined in the rules of the sport, it is not possible to absolutely ensure that contact between players will not occur, and that injuries will not be sustained. Members are reminded that they engage in the sport entirely at their own risk.</p>
<p>Given that %short_name% offers the sport of Ultimate at varied and dispersed locations, and does not have officials such as referees at the games, it falls to the Captains and players of the teams participating in the game to be responsible for the safety of the site at which they are playing. Captains and players are jointly responsible to examine the %field% before their game begins, to determine if it is safe. They are responsible for taking appropriate action if they feel that their safety is being compromised by playing on what they consider an unsafe %field%; this includes but is not limited to the refusal, as a team or individually, to play on a site they deem to be potentially hazardous. %short_name% never forces its members to play when they are not comfortable doing so; games can easily be rescheduled.</p>
<p>While participating in %short_name% sponsored games of Ultimate, all players have the duty to take reasonable efforts to ensure their own safety, the safety of their teammates, and the safety of the opposing players. This includes but is not limited to the refusal, as a team or individually, to play against an opponent they feel is playing in an unsafe manner, and forcing a teammate to stop playing if s/he is alleged to be playing in an unsafe manner by a teammate or by a member of the opposing team acting in good faith. Captains have the additional duty to discuss any safety issues with the Captain from the opposing team, where (a) a teammate requests that such a discussion be held; and/or (b) when the Captain deems that it is necessary to do so.</p>
